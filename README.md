# YouTube Descriptions

This repository hosts my scripts that I use to generate my YouTube video titles and descriptions. This is provided as-is, and you are free to use and adjust on your liking.

## Usage

1. Edit the required values on the script.
2. Run the script directly with Node.js (e.g. `node Black MIDI.js`).
3. Copy the title and the description to YouTube manually.
